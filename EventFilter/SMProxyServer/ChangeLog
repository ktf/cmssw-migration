	* tag V03-02-01
	* Add specialization for ConsumerUtils template in SMProxy,
	  and not in StorageManager.

2011-05-09 Remi Mommsen <Remigius.Mommsen@cern.ch>
	* tag V03-02-00
	* Don't fail if we receive a corrupted event from the SM.
	* Keep track of how many events were corrupted and raise
	  a sentinel alarm if there's a too high rate.

2011-04-04 Remi Mommsen <Remigius.Mommsen@cern.ch>
	* tag V03-01-00
	* Merge changes from tag V02-01-00 (branch_3_10_x)
	  into trunk.

	* tag V03-00-00
	* Merge new SMPS based on tag V02-00-02 (branch_3_10_x)
	  into trunk.
	* This tag requires IOPool/Streamer V07-01-00 or later.

2011-04-04 Remi Mommsen <Remigius.Mommsen@cern.ch>
	* tag V02-01-00
	* Adjust to API change in DQMEventStore in SM V07-03-00.

	* Rewrite of SMPS (from SMPSdev_branch)

2011-02-17 Remi Mommsen <Remigius.Mommsen@cern.ch>
	* tag V01-11-00
	* Minimal changes for modified IOPool/Streamer V07-01-00

2011-03-24 Remi Mommsen <Remigius.Mommsen@cern.ch>
	* tag V01-10-04
	* Fix signedness of loop variable.

2011-03-24 Remi Mommsen <Remigius.Mommsen@cern.ch>

2010-10-27 William Tanenbaum <wmtan@fnal.gov>
	* tag V01-10-02
	* Convert BuildFiles to XML.

2010-09-20 Luis I. Lopera <lilopera@cern.ch>
	* tag V01-10-01
	* Fix for connection retries.

2010-09-17 Luis I. Lopera <lilopera@cern.ch>
	* tag V01-10-00
	* Allow to disable DQM Queues where they are not needed. Thus reducing network traffic.
	* Eliminates unresponsive SM servers from the list. This fixes the delays observed when
	  trying high frequency consumers and improves overall performance as the SMPS. This
	  procedure only occurs at the registration point, and it guaranties that after n retries
	  the server will go in to status fully registered.
	* The SMSenders webpage now reflects which SM where registered and which where not.
	* Configurable number of retries.

2010-03-17 Srecko Morovic <Srecko.Morovic@cern.ch>
	* tag V01-09-05

2010-02-23 Srecko Morovic <Srecko.Morovic@cern.ch>
	* tag V01-09-03
	* improved version of queue restarting, timeouts etc.


2010-02-18 Srecko Morovic <Srecko.Morovic@cern.ch>
	* tag V01-09-02
	* Restarting of queues (always or after timeout),
	  Use alwaysRestartQueue and queueTimeout (unsignedInt).
	* New locking between consumer callbacks, fsm functions
	  and timer workloop.

2010-02-16 Srecko Morovic <Srecko.Morovic@cern.ch>

	* tag V01-09-01
	* Added support for client-side queue definition (enabled by
	  selectionFromClient Xdaq parameter). Rate, output module
	  and trigger selection are taken from the client, ignoring
	  SMProxy parameters. Any subsequent client connection will
	  be attached to the same stream.
	* Moved dpm intialization into separate function
	* Proxy now reads run number from events into "runNumber" infospace
	  item (to be used by function manager in non-live system)


2010-01-11 Remi Mommsen <Remigius.Mommsen@cern.ch>

	* tag V01-09-00
	* Introduce a finer grained event selection allowing for and/not
	  combination of triggers in a given HLT path when using the
	  'TriggerSelector' parameter
	* Add configuration parameter 'dropOldLumisectionEvents' to
	  discard events from previous lumi sections
	* Use explicit brackets to avoid compiler warning

2009-08-19  Remi Mommsen <remigius.mommsen@cern.ch>

	* tag V01-08-15
	* Add the option 'esSelectedEventSelection', an array of strings, used to
	  specify the event selection used by the proxy server when requesting
	  events from the StorageManager.

2009-05-22  Kurt Biery <biery@fnal.gov>

	* tag V01-08-14
	* Modified the DataProcessManager to avoid using the new Utils
	  functions in the refactored SM (so it will be independent of
	  the new SM, for now).

2009-05-22  Kurt Biery <biery@fnal.gov>

	* tag V01-08-13
	* Added the allowMissingSM configuration parameter to control
	  whether we require all storage managers in the SMRegistrationList
	  to be present before fetching events.  When the allowMissingSM
	  parameter is set to true, the SMPS will fetch events from the
	  SMs that are available and periodically attempt to contact the
	  missing SMs.  When it is set to false (the default), it tries
	  forever to contact the missing SMs before fetching any events.

2009-05-04  Kurt Biery <biery@fnal.gov>

	* tag V01-08-12
	* Changed the default HLT output module for events that will be sent
	  to online event consumers from "out4DQM" to "hltOutputDQM".

2009-04-17  Kurt Biery <biery@fnal.gov>

	* tag V01-08-11
	* Removed references to obsolete SM code (Configurator and
	  ProgressMarker).

2009-04-17  Kurt Biery <biery@fnal.gov>

	* tag V01-08-10
	* Removed the functionality that allowed event consumers to
	  specify the trigger path part of their event selection using
	  the name of a Storage Manager output stream.  (This functionality
	  will no longer be supported by the Storage Manager.)

2009-04-13  Kurt Biery <biery@fnal.gov>

	* tag V01-08-09
	* Added the requested HLT output module parameter to the event
	  consumer registration request in preparation for the new
	  storage manager code.

2009-01-27  Kurt Biery <biery@fnal.gov>

	* tag V01-08-08
	* Modified the sending of event consumer registration requests
	  to work around the recent change in edm::ParameterSet to only
	  serialize tracked parameters.

2008-11-21  Kurt Biery <biery@fnal.gov>

	* tag V01-08-07
	* Added RCMS infospace parameters and findRcmsStateListener call
	  to avoid crash in FSM during configure step with
	  EventFilter/Utilities V00-15-01.

2008-10-14  Harry Cheung <cheung@fnal.gov>

	* tag V01-08-06
	* Fixed to use new SMPerformanceMeter and include time period based
	  statistics as well as sampled based

2008-08-13  Kurt Biery <biery@fnal.gov>

	* tag V01-08-05
	* Added /consumerList web page for Bill Badgett.

2008-06-25  Kurt Biery <biery@fnal.gov>

	* tag V01-08-04
	* Added archiveIntervalDQM configuration parameter to control how often
	  we archive DQM histograms (once every N lumi sections, where
	  archiveIntervalDQM = N)

2008-06-16  Kurt Biery <biery@fnal.gov>

	* tag V01-08-03
	* Modification of the EventServer to match what was run in
	  Cruzet2 (fair-share off, rates limited at the EventServer input, and
	  events for consumers restricted to a single HLT output module).

2008-05-14  Harry Cheung <cheung@fnal.gov>

	* tag V01-08-02
	* Kurt's changes to include Event Server statistics by HLT output module to enable easier
	  debugging of event rates to DQM consumers

2008-05-11  Harry Cheung <cheung@fnal.gov>

	* tag V01-08-01
	* Fix processing loop so that SMProxy gets INIT message from all Storage Managers else
	  will not receive events from all SMs

2008-05-05  Harry Cheung <cheung@fnal.gov>

	* tag V01-08-00
	* Changes from Kurt for SM selecting on HLT ouptut module ID and INIT message change

2008-02-02  Harry Cheung <cheung@fnal.gov>

        * tag V01-05-01
        * Fix the monitoring of statistics and allow setting of the maximum
          request rates and server rates in the SMProxyServer XML config file

2008-01-28  Harry Cheung <cheung@fnal.gov>

        * tag V01-05-00
        * Implement SMProxyServer as a pull mode consumer

2007-12-12  Harry Cheung <cheung@fnal.gov>

        * tag V01-04-00
        * changes to handle consumer queue interface change

2007-10-14  Harry Cheung <cheung@fnal.gov>

        * tag V01-03-04
        * changes to enter a fail state when a config, enable, or stop action
          is performed and a problem occurs. Also changes for reporting the
          current state in the application web page and reporting reason for
          entering fail state.
        * Check that DQM archive output base path (if archiving is requested)
          actually exist during configure action, go into fail state if
          it does not exist.
        * fix icon paths
